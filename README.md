# Sentiment-Analysis of Twitter Dataset
In this project, we delve into understanding the sentiment expressed in tweets through the lens of machine learning. Our goal is to effectively classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments utilizing a combination of Random Forest classification and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization techniques.

# Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: We perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing on the Twitter dataset to ensure quality and consistency in our analysis.

Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF vectorization, we extract relevant features from the text data, transforming it into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Training: Leveraging Random Forest classification, we train a robust model capable of accurately predicting sentiment labels for tweets.

Model Evaluation: We assess the performance of our trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure its effectiveness in sentiment classification.
